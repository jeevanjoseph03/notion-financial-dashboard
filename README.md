## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive system for personal finance management built entirely in Notion. I created it to have a flexible, all-in-one solution that goes beyond simple tracking to include goal setting, net worth calculation, and intentional spending habits. The dashboard provides a clear, real-time picture of your financial health.

## Features

This system is built on a relational database structure and includes the following features:

* **Accounts & Net Worth Tracker:** Track all your financial accounts like bank accounts, credit cards, and loans in one place. Every account is classified as an asset or liability to automatically update your net worth.
* **Income Tracker:** Log every stream of income and track your earnings against monthly targets.
* **Expense Tracker:** Log and categorize every expense to see exactly where your money goes. View expenses by list, calendar, or chart.
* **Budgeting:** Assign monthly budgets by category and track your spending against your goals.
* **Goal Tracker:** Set clear financial goals, from an emergency fund to a big milestone, and track your progress automatically.
* **Financial Snapshot:** Get a clear, automated summary of your financial health, including monthly/yearly balance and a real-time net worth calculation.
